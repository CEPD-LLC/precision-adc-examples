## Introduction

Precision Analog to Digital Converters from Texas Instruments are specialized mixed signal products mainly used in signal acquisition and sensor applications.  Generally, these products communicate with a micro-controller or FPGA as an SPI or I2C peripheral to configure internal settings and transmit digitized analog signals.  

This repository is a collection of firmware examples for controlling, configuring, reading, and interacting with these products.  You will find examples of micro-controller firmware applications which configure and operate these ADCs.
